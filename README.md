# Warning

This library is archived and will not be maintained. The recommended maintained alternative is [FriendsOfBehat/SymfonyExtension](https://github.com/FriendsOfBehat/SymfonyExtension).

There is also a fork at [https://github.com/PHPExpertsInc/SymfonyExtension/](https://github.com/PHPExpertsInc/SymfonyExtension/)
which added support for PHP 8.x and Symfony <= 7. It claims to be entirely backwards compatible with this library 
(meaning it shares the same architectural flaws that originally prompted the new extension). It is **not officially 
recommended** by the Behat maintainers, but it may be useful as a temporary migration path for existing projects.
